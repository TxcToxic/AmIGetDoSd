# AmIGetDoS'd

A little project by -TOXIC-#1835 for [Lightning-Gaming](https://lightning-gaming.eu/)

# Credits & Code Ripping

This is a OpenSource-Project which means you're able to use but you could keep credits (ex. // Code by -TOXIC-#1835)

The Credits don't have to be public!

Skids that are ripping code are little sluts!
